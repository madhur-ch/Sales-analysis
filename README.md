# Sales-analysis
I created an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Advanced Microsoft Excel to analyze sales executives’ performance across multiple regions. The dashboard showcases Top 5 and Bottom 5 performers, Target Hit %, and Away From Target %, with easy region-wise analysis using slicers. 
I used Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Macros to automate insights and designed column, bar, line, and pie charts for clear data visualization. 
This project helps identify performance gaps and supports data-driven sales decisions, while strengthening my skills in Excel, data analysis, and dashboard design.
